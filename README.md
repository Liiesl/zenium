# ZenIUM

When [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) is your daily driver, but you need Chromium dev tools.

ZenIUM is yet another minimalist, vertical-tab browser for those who appreciate the modern, clean, and sleek user interfaces of browsers like Arc and Zen, but require the power and compatibility of the Chromium engine. It's built for a superior browsing experience without the clutter of mainstream alternatives.

## Why ZenIUM?

Let's face it. You've embraced the future of browsing with modern, Arc-style successors like Zen, Floorp, and others, but reality often gets in the way. Their reliance on Firefox's Gecko engine means some websites, for better or worse, just don't render properly or function correctly on the Gecko engine, forcing you to keep a Chromium-based browser on hand just to get things done.

On top of that, if you're building modern web applications and SaaS products, you often need Chromium's best-in-class developer tools. The dev tools in Firefox can feel lacking, pushing you back to a Chromium environment for serious work.

But going back to Chrome just to view a site or for development leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The user interface is cluttered, uninspired, and frankly, a step down from the elegant, focused experience you've grown to love.

This is the gap ZenIUM comes in.

It's for anyone who needs to use a Chromium-based browser—whether for compatibility or development—but refuses to settle for a subpar UI. Get the modern, vertical-tabbed, and minimalist aesthetic you want, built on the powerful engine you actually need.
